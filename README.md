# Simple Animal Killer Minecraft Plugin
A message will be displayed with an animal to kill in-game. Succeed and move onto the next round. Fail and you are eliminated. Win when you're the last player still in the game.







This is a commissioned project which fell through. Unfortunately my more serious and complex projects in Java are under commission so I'm unable to show them on Github. Feel free to ask personally about my experience with them.
